# Arevangular

My own implementation of [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/), following the instructions of the eBook [*Build your own AngularJS*](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular/), by Tero Parviainen.

The original Github repository with the complete project is [here](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs)

The name of the library is based in my surname: Arévalo
